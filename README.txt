CSE 504N Object-Oriented Software Development Laboratory

This course will expose you to the syntax, semantics, and standard libraries of the C++ language; to common C++ design and implementation idioms; and to many opportunities to apply the knowledge and idioms you learn through hands-on studio exercises and projects in C++.

All programming in this course will be done in C++, a language in which you can combine the object-oriented, procedural, and generic programming ideas with which you'll gain experience throughout the semester. 

Since many students enter this course with experience in Java but not C++, the early portion of the syllabus is designed to give you a breadth-first experience of the major capabilities and features of C++ and to assist your progress up the rest of the C++ learning curve. 

In addition to providing a reasonable coverage of the C++ language overall, this course also will focus on new features recently introduced to C++ and its libraries, particularly those from the C++11 standard.
