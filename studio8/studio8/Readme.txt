2. Before adding the constructor:
Severity	Code	Description	Project	File	Line	Suppression State
Error	C4700	 uninitialized local variable 'name' used	studio8	H:\cse332\studio8-liuxiesult\studio8\studio8\studio8.cpp	12	

After adding the constructor:
x: 0 y: 0

3. Structs are default public; classes are default public. Had to declare class member variables and constructor as public to access them.

4. x: 0 y: 0
const x: 0 const y: 0
x: 10 y: 10

5. m.x = 0 and m.y = 0
m.x = 7 and m.y = 3
n.x = 7 and n.y = 3

The default constructor initializes x and y to zero, and the copy constructor sets the values to the same as the other point.

6. No difference.
