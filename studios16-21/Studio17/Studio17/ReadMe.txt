2.  The helper function should be private.
    We created a vector v = { 'X', ' ', 'X', ' ', 'X', ' ', 'X', ' ', 'X', '3' }, and an ImageFile object
    to read it and write it. Our program correctly outputs:

	X   X
	  X
	X   X

3. Programming using an interface rather than a concrete class makes it easy to extend the software in the 
   future. It allows us to start with small applications and gradually build upon the interface. It makes 
   the program more flexible and the program can be used in more situations.

4. Probably adding code in the createFile() method, as it currently only supports creating "txt" and 
   "img" file.
